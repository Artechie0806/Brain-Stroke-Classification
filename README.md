#üß† Brain Stroke Detection with Vision Transformer (ViT-B16)
This project demonstrates a deep learning application for brain stroke classification from CT scan images using a Vision Transformer (ViT-B16) architecture. A lightweight Flask web app allows users to interactively upload CT scans and receive predictions powered by the trained model.
